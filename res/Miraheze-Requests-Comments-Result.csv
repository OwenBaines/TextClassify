A complete introduction to observing and understanding the night sky, this wiki takes you from the very basics of stargazing through to the skills you need t become an accomplished amateur astronomer. This beginner's guide explains and demystifies the night sky, teaching you to recognize and identify its features, from constellations to comets. Practical advice begins with observation with the naked eye. Illustrated, step-by-step instructions also show you how to set up and use binoculars and telescopes, and how to taken your own pictures of the night sky. Astropedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Astropedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Users can contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity. The fundamental principles by which Astropedia operates are the five pillars. The Astropedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing. Astropedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, Astropedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Astropedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well. Astropedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of completion. As articles develop, they tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. Quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired.",accept

By default, the name added will be the head of state of the country in which the extinction event occurred. However, we will crowdsource the documentation of particular instances where other people are more directly accountable.
